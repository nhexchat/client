# Downloading

See the [latest release](https://github.com/nhexirc/nhex/releases/latest) to download installers for Debian-based Linux distros, Windows & Mac OS.

# Using

See [the documentation](https://nhex.dev/docs/) for full usage details.

# Developing

## Prerequisites

* [Tauri pre-requisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/) ([node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) & [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

#### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run tauri dev
```

## Building

[![Build Check](https://github.com/nhexirc/nhex/actions/workflows/build_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhexirc/nhex/actions/workflows/build_check.yml)

### Locally

```shell
$ npm run tauri build
```

### In CI/CD

You can manually trigger builds by prepending `dev-build/` to any branch name.

All Pull Requests will automatically trigger the development pipeline.

The development pipeline will create a draft pre[release](https://github.com/nhexirc/nhex/releases) with your assets attached.

### Development Guidelines

1. This is **not** a source-level port! This is an entirely new application wholly _inspired by_ the best (IMHO) GUI IRC client that ever existed. RIP HexChat.
   * In fact, source introspection is *prohibited* for contributors! Black-box behavioral inspection of HexChat (e.g. use it, see how it works, replicate the behavior) is the only allowed form of HexChat inspection.
1. **Do not** share state between components! This is *paramount* for future maintainability. If one component (`A`) must affect the state of another (`B`), we use the actor model: `A` sends the appropriate message on the event system which `B` listens for and updates its internal state accordingly.
1. Lift out of Rust _early_ & _often_. So, as long as it is reasonable & performant* to do so, implementation should prefer to live in the frontend not the backend.
    * \* It nearly _always_ will be: this is an IRC client, not a 120 FPS video game.
    * This contributes directly to the [long-term goal of extracting the UX into a web app!](https://github.com/nhexirc/client/issues/17)
1. 7 is a theme in design for nhex: include as subtly as possible! (["Hexa"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix#Table_of_number_prefixes_in_English) is a prefix for "six", plus one, hence 7.)

### Creating a release

Use the included [`create-release` script](/packages/client/scripts/create-release) to prepare the release:

```shell
$ ./scripts/create-release major
```

Where `major` is the release type as supported by [`semver.inc()`](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/semver). If not provided, the default value for this argument is `patch`.

The script will increment the appropriate `version` field in all necessary metadata files and provide a set of `git` CLI invocations to commit, tag & push the release.

Any tag beginning with `v` will trigger the release pipeline, and this script suggests just a tag to be used.

The resulting [release](https://github.com/nhexirc/nhex/releases) will be a draft - not yet visible to the public - until you publish it. When you do, please include a short high-level description of the release and use GitHub's "Create Release Notes" functionality to generate a changelog.

## Contributors
